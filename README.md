gti.py
======

Just a silly `git` launcher, basically. Inspired by `sl`.

A port of the original [gti][] in Python.

Install
-------

```sh
curl https://raw.github.com/gsamokovarov/gti.py/master/gti > bin/gti
```

Requires Python greater than `2.3`. Works on Python 3 too.

Usage
-----

Try typing `git` really fast, on an unfamiliar keyboard.
